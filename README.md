# cpp generic geometry library
## Note  
I will discontinue the templates and focus on implementing efficient template-free mathematical types. That will help to try SIMD.

Just learning some more advanced C++ here, using templates and SFINAE extensively.
Ultimately, this project serves as a learning base for a more complexe 2D/3D centered C++ library for physic and particle simulation that I plan on building.
